I am Chi Jun. You can call me Jun or June as well.
I spend most of my time playing video games and when I&amp;rsquo;m not, you will probably find me napping somewhere else.
In the rare occassion that I&amp;rsquo;m doing neither of those activites, I would spend my time on piano practicing, book reading, or screwing around with some side projects (like updating this site).
Feel free to reach out to me at pcjun97@gmail.</description></item></channel></rss>
