Oh, hey there!
I am June.

Well, my actual name is Poh Chi Jun, which is a Malaysia-variant Chinese name
("Poh" is my family name).

I spend most of my time playing video games
and when I'm not, you will probably find me napping somewhere else.

In the rare occassion that I'm doing neither of those activites,
I would spend my time on piano practicing, book reading,
or screwing around with some [side projects](https://github.com/pcjun97)
(like updating this site).

Feel free to reach out to me at <pcjun97@gmail.com>
or send me a tweet me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pcjun97).
Also, you can find my resume [here](/resume.pdf).
